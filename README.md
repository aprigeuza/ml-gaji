# Simplified Machine Learning for Calculating Salaries Based on Education and Experience

In this example, we create a simple dataset with columns for experience, education, and salary. Next, we separate the features (experience and education) from the target variable (salary), split the dataset into training and testing data, and build a linear regression model to predict salaries based on experience and education. The model is then evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2), and finally used to make salary predictions for given values of experience and education. You can replace the dataset and model parameters as per your specific use case.

## Prerequisites

#### Installing Python

Make sure that you have [Python installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine.

#### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies that are required for the project by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Launching Jupyter Locally

All demos in the project may be run directly in your browser without installing Jupyter locally. But if you want to launch [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) locally you may do it by running the following command from the root folder of the project:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
After this Jupyter Notebook will be accessible by `http://localhost:8888`.

## Datasets

To replace the data within the dataset, you can modify the entries in the sample.csv file.
